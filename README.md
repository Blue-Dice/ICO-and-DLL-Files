# **ICO and DLL Generator**

> A simple python script that scans the entire current working directory and create .ico files for all the available images.
> These .ico files are then bundled together into a dll file
> This dll file can now be used to change folder icons on windows desktop

--> I created these scripts because I wanted to make a "one piece" themed desktop for my computer and I have also included all the images I wanted to create a dll of in the repo.
